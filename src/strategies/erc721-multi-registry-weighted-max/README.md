This is to calculate the balance of the wallets in a multi-registry contract.
Calculation is weighted with a maxBalance parameter.

Here is an example of parameters:

```{
    "symbol": "Total",
    "tokens": [
    "0x3106a0a076BeDAE847652F42ef07FD58589E001f",
    "0xb986Fd52697f16bE888bFAD2c5bF12cd67Ce834B",
    "0xb2d4F230298Cf68164F6C5DD994068Cbb4C3D335"
    ],
    "maxBalance": 200000,
    "weights": [1, 5, 10]
}
```
